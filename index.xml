Key Speakers Dr. Jane Smith, University of Example Prof. John Doe, Research Institute Summary The panel explored how scientists can bridge the gap between complex research and public understanding. Speakers shared examples from their work in science communication and public engagement.

We believe that scientific progress thrives when researchers can effectively communicate with the public. Many societal advancements are rooted in the scientific process; however, the scientific research ecosystem is not optimized to bridge communication gaps between scientists and their local community members and leaders.</description></item><item><title>Brewing Scientists</title><link>https://scopecomms.github.io/brewing-scientists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scopecomms.github.io/brewing-scientists/</guid><description>About Brewing Scientists Combining science communication with craft brewing to create engaging public events in collaboration with Steel String Brewery.
Our Approach Scientists create beer labels with accessible language about their research findings. The public events include scientific presentations geared for the local community, benefiting both scientists and non-scientists.
Beer Series We collaborate with Steel String Brewery to create science-themed beverages that communicate complex research in accessible ways.
Loopapalooza Pale Ale This pale ale features educational content about DNA folding and its role in genetic diseases.</description></item><item><title>Social Media</title><link>https://scopecomms.github.io/social-media/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scopecomms.github.io/social-media/</guid><description>Follow SCOPE on Social Media Stay connected with our latest events, panels, and science communication resources.
