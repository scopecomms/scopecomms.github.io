<h2 id=our-mission>Our Mission</h2>
<p>SCOPE (Science Communication and Outreach for Public Engagement) was founded with a clear purpose: to equip scientists from all career stages, backgrounds, and disciplines with the tools to build, maintain, and strengthen their communities' trust in science.</p>
<p>We believe that scientific progress thrives when researchers can effectively communicate with the public. Many societal advancements are rooted in the scientific process; however, the scientific research ecosystem is not optimized to bridge communication gaps between scientists and their local community members and leaders.</p>
<h2 id=our-founders>Our Founders</h2>
<h3 id=jp-flores>JP Flores</h3>
<p>JP Flores is a graduate student at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and an HHMI Gilliam Fellow. His research focuses on DNA organization in the cell nucleus and its role in pediatric cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p>
<p>Beyond the laboratory, JP is passionate about creating innovative spaces for science communication. He hosts the podcast &ldquo;From where does it STEM?&rdquo; and serves on the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools Biomedical Sciences Advisory Board. JP brings his expertise in translating complex genomic concepts into accessible formats through the Brewing Scientists initiative.</p>
<h3 id=angelique-allen>Angelique Allen</h3>
<p>Angelique Allen is a graduate student at the University of Oregon and an HHMI Gilliam Fellow. Her research explores the fascinating world of octopus biology and neurodevelopment.</p>
<p>Angelique pioneered the concept of communicating science through beer labels during her time in Eugene, Oregon, creating an innovative outreach event that engaged community members who don&rsquo;t typically attend traditional science events. Her creative approach to science communication inspires SCOPE&rsquo;s mission to meet people where they are with accessible scientific content.</p>
<h2 id=our-approach>Our Approach</h2>
<p>We believe that building trust in science requires:</p>
